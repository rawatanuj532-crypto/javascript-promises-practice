# JavaScript Promises Practice

This file contains my practice and learning notes about **JavaScript Promises**. I created it while trying to understand how asynchronous operations work in JavaScript and how promises help manage them better than traditional callbacks.

## Topics Covered

In this file, I explored:

- Creating promises using `new Promise()`
- Understanding `resolve` and `reject`
- Handling responses using `.then()` and `.catch()`
- Learning how promise chaining works
- Practicing real examples to understand asynchronous flow
